                it looks like you&apos;re playing the game in preview mode. this
                means that google maps loadss <em>without</em> api key and
                therefore can&apos;t display map data. you can still play the
                game and take a glance at how it works.

              the gameplay is simple. first, enter your name and prefered game
              settings and select a map. if you&apos;re unsure about the
              location, you can preview it by clicking the icon next to the map
              dropdown.

              once you start the game, it will find a random street view
              panorama somewhere on the map. click &quot;start round&quot; and,
              if you set a time limit, hurry up! if you think you know where you
              are, click the map icon in the bottom right corner and set your
              position.

              project that aims to make it possible for everyone to explore any
              place in the world, without any limitations. it&apos;s built using
              data from google maps. at the time of writing, every google
              account gets 200$ per month for free to spend on the google maps
              platform.

            <paragraphing>
              instead of paying for a service, the idea behind amnesia is
              that everyone brings their own api key associated with their
              account. the game is optimized to use very little data from google
              maps - 200$ per month can last for thousands of games.
